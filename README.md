# squawkBox
A piCore based light weight operating system with everything needed for low cost, lightweight voip services.

For this project my main goals in order will be
  1. Implement basic chat room type voip services using only raspberry pis
      A. I plan on starting with purely cli based interface to minimize overhead and hardware requirements
      B. The main contendor for used voip service is Mumble, specifically the talKKonect or murmur-cli clients.
  3. Use ad-hoc networking on the pis to allow routerless p2p communication.
